# AD-Tools

## Overview

This repository is a collection of the tools, binaries and scripts that I use when I am doing an audit or a machine that deals with **active directory**.

The whole repository is basically a **backup** of mine so that I have everything at hand and can easily set up the environment when I'm on another computer. I don't know how often I will update it, but you can use it as you see fit.
